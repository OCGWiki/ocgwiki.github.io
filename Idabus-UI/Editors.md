## What are editors
Editors are reusable components, which can be used to show and edit attribute values.

With editors attribute values can be represented in different ways (like checkbox, combobox, date time picker etc.) and their behaviors (like validation, suggestion, event handler etc.) can be compeletely customised.

Furthermore, the access rights is a built-in feature in the editors. You don't have to worry about if the login user has read or write access to the attribute values. If he has no corresponding access rights, the editors will be hidden or turned to readonly mode automatically.
