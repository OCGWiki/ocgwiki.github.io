#Breaking changes

- TSLint has been replaced with ESLint, run "yarn" before compile the code using "ng serve"
- The name of the "change" event listener of all editors has been renamed to "valueChange" to avoid native event listener. If event handler was defined for "change()" in custom code, it should be adjusted to use "valueChange()"

#Feature highlights

- Using ESLint to find and fix problems. Run yarn lint to start the check
- Added approval / request view as a separate view
- Added UI for dataflow rule (IDABUS only)
- Added photo editor to corp and upload profile photo
- Workflow activities can be configured to show debug information
- Added an example to show how "delete all" in identity-list works
- Navigating away from a unsaved editing view will trigger a confirmation to remind people to save their works
- Resource-table and its export results support now sort and filter
- Page size of the tree-view can be now defined separately from page size of resource-table
- Identity-browser uses now the emptySearchMaxCount property of an identity- / identities-editor as its page size
