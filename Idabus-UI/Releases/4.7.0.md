#Breaking Changes

- If using status column in a resource table, the data structure has been changed
from:
`showStatus: { trueValue: string, faluseValue: string, trueColor: string, falseColor: string }`
to:
`showStatus: { [key: string]: { text: string, color: string } }`
`fallbackStatus: { [key: string]: { text: string, color: string } }`
- Added delete button in brand-view menu. If delete function is already implemented in custom service, a "return true" should be added at the end of the delete function
