#Breaking Changes

- Copy the assets/theme folder from the UI Customisation Repository to your customisation project to apply theme settings
- Data service version 4.3.0 is needed, which fixes the broken link bug (identity-link is broken by showing a none accessible identity)
- Misspelling - change onViewRemoveIdentites to onViewRemoveIdentities in custom.service.ts

# Building

Use the following build command to avoid webpage caching (works only for IIS, not for IDABUS)
```js
ng build --base-href "/portal/" --output-hashing=all
```

#Feature Highlights

- Implemented virtual scroll in resource-table and identity-list (not yet identity-picker)
- Add / remove attributes in config-mode now doesn't discard unsaved configuration changes
- Added a new event hook onViewBeforeSave to handle event before save button in resource detail-view is clicked
- Identity-Picker can new be used in XPath-builder to specify identities
