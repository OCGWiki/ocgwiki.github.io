# Breaking Changes

- OCG Data Service should be now hosted as main website in IIS, OCG UI should be hosted as application unter OCG Data Service. Please refer to [installation section](/IDABUS-Identity-Solution/Installation/Portal-Installation) for more details
- If encounter an error in web.config, try to delete the "<staticCount>" block. This block is reserved for IDABUS service
- If update OCG UI project to this version, execute "yarn" direct after the update to install ngx-graph and angular-mgl-timeline components
- Double check the settings for assignment table in the detail view for users and roles. Make sure, that the XPath is indeed set to query assignment objects, not user or role objects. A wrong setting could lead to deletion of users or roles.
