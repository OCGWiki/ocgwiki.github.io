Welcome to the IDABUS® UI Documentation

## About the IDABUS® UI

The Microsoft® Identity Manager provides its own user interface for the administration of objects within the Identity & Access Management (IAM) system. The configuration options (design, layout and function) of this standard interface are greatly enhanced by the IDABUS® User Interface (IDABUS® UI), formerly known as the OCG UI.

The IDABUS® UI provides a user interface suitable for administrators and end users alike, which can be adapted to individual and customer-specific requirements.

In this Documentation you can learn how you can set up the IDABUS UI and adapt it to your needs. Should you seek information that is not part of this documentation yet, feel free to get in [contact](https://ocg.de/Unternehmen/Kontakt) with us directly to answer your questions.

## Getting Started
Read about the installation and the initial set up in the [Installation Guide](/installation/) Section.

After the initial setup you will want to customize the instance to your needs in more detail. You can find Guides regarding that in our [Guides Section](/guides/)

## How to adapt the UI to your needs
There are multiple ways to adapt the IDABUS UI. Many things can be done via the UI, like adapting the dashboard(s), defining how the wizards and editors of objects look like and more. You can find more about this here:
- [Editors](/editors/)
- Dashboard - coming soond
- Wizards - coming soon

If you want to go deeper, you can learn about how to change the settings file to adapt the UI even more, and to add your own customized code here:
- [UI Settings](/uisettings/)
- [Event Hooks](/eventHooks)
- [Theming](/theming/)
