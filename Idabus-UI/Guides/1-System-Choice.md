# Scenario

When launching the IDABUSÂ® UI web page, the first dialog appearing is the **connection choice**, in the following referred to as **System-Choice**. Here you decide which instance you want to connect to. The  **System-Choice** can also be deactivated and the dialog will be skipped.

On a newly installed system it will offer the following three options by default:
- Contoso Dev _(meant to be an on-Premise system)_
- Contoso VM _(meant to be an on-Premise system)_
- OCG DE Demo _(meant to be a Cloud system)_

To select a system click on the right-arrow next to it.

# Configuration
The System-Choice can be configured in the <span style="color: #8000FC">**"systems"**</span> key within the following JSON file:
`C:\inetpub\Oxford Computer Group\IDABUS UI\portal\app\customisation\assets\config\customConfig.dev.json`
>_In older Versions the "Idabus UI" folder  might be called "OCG UI"_
<br>

If <span style="color: #8000FC">**"systems"**</span> does not yet exist in this file best practice is to copy it from the following file:
`C:\inetpub\Oxford Computer Group\IDABUS UI\portal\assets\config\config.dev.json`

# Additional Recommendations

1. If you want the UI to connect to one system only, set <span style="color: #8000FC"> systems.enabled</span> to false. Then the whole <span style="color: #8000FC"> systems</span> block will be disregarded.
2. If you want to add a second system after setting up only one connection, you can just:
  2.1 Set <span style="color: #8000FC"> systems.enabled</span> to true
  2.2 Create an item for the already existing system with <span style="color: #8000FC"> config</span>: {}
  2.3 Create an item for the new connection and add anything you wish to change in its <span style="color: #8000FC"> config</span>, for example the <span style="color: #8000FC">dataServiceUrl</span>
